# ElfosV5
All things Elf/OS V5

With the demise of elf-emulation.com I have created this GitHub repository
to house all materials for Elf/OS v5.  Keep an eye on this repostiry for
any news or updates concerning Elf/OS v5.

Status as of 12/4/2023:
  The kernel has passed initial testing is pretty much ready for beta release

  The files that touch dirents: dir, touch, and chmod have had new version 
  made for Elf/OS v5

  I have working C-based setup programs that can create new disk images with
  Elf/OS v5 and basic tools installed (still would need to extract basetools5.blr)

  I have a working 1802 assembly installer now for type I filesystems, and will ahve
  an 1802 asembly for type II within the next day or two

  With the installers it should be possible to install brand new disks with Elf/OS 5,
  using type II, up to 136gb disks can now be used.

  Due to a change in directory structure, an upgrade tool for Elf/OS 4 and before needs
  to still be completed.  I have a c version that can upgrade disk images on a pc, I
  still need to convert the tool to 1802 assembly for running on actual hardware.

  Once all of the tools are completed for both new installations as well as upgrading
  old installations is done, then I will post the beta releases of the whole Elf/OS v5
  system.  I anticipate having this done by the end of the week.
